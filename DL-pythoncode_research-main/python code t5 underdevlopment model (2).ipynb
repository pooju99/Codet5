Doing so reduces the step time to the maximum (as opposed to the sum) of the training and the time it takes to extract the data. The `tf.data` API provides the `tf.data.Dataset.prefetch` transformation. It can be used to decouple the time when data is produced from the time when data is consumed. The number of elements to prefetch should be equal to (or possibly greater than) the number of batches consumed by a single training step. You could either manually tune this value, or set it to `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`, which will prompt the `tf.data` runtime to tune the value dynamically at runtime."
